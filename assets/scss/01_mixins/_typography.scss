/// Quickly assigns different `font-size` and/or `line-heights` to a specified heading tag and/or class at each 
/// specified breakpoint by providing a `Map` variable. The `Map` is simply a list of key/value pairs similar 
/// to JSON.
/// 
/// Each key provided in the `Map` must match a key available in `$grid-breakpoints`. Each value must be its own 
/// `Map` containing a list of css properties (as the keys) and css values (as the values). See the example below. 
/// Please note, although these look like (and infact are) valid css properties â€“ you must separate each item 
/// with a comma (,) and not a semi-colon (:) for it to be a valid SCSS `Map`. Otherwise, it'll throw an error 
/// and your css will fail to compile properly.
/// 
/// **IMPORTANT:** This mixin is only available in `Theme Options > Misc > Additional CSS` and not inside the 
/// `Bootstrap Override Vars` field. If you attempt to add it to the wrong box, it will throw an error and your 
/// css will fail to compile properly.
/// 
/// **IMPORTANT:** Please remember to choose your selectors wisely and thoroughly. If you use `h1`, more than 
/// likely you also want to use `.h1`. So, you could add it as follows `h1, .h1 { ... }`.
/// 
/// **IMPORTANT:** This theme is built to be "mobile-first", which means any values added via Theme Options are 
/// assigned to mobile. By including the `xs` breakpoint in the `Map`, you will effectively be overriding 
/// anything you have put in the corresponding Theme Options field.
/// 
/// **ADDITIONAL NOTE:** Although this mixin is intended to be used for setting `font-size` and `line-height`, 
/// it can be used with ANY valid css properties/values. Want to change the color at the `md` breakpoint? You can 
/// do that with this mixin.
/// 
/// @example 
///     h1, .h1 {
///         @include bb-heading-responsive((
///                 xs: (font-size: 0.2rem, line-height: 1.5),
///                 md: (font-size: 1rem, line-height: 1.1),
///                 lg: (font-size: 10rem, line-height: 0.9)
///             )
///         );
///     }
/// 
/// @parameter {Map} $sizes - A Map where each key is a valid `$grid-breakpoints` key, and the .
