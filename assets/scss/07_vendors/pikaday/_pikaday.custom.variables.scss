// BentoBox: These are custom variables and not part of Pikaday's SCSS.
//           
//           NOTES:
//           - Pikaday's SCSS files no longer include variables (not sure why), so the following
//             variables are custom created variables to control various parts of Pikaday that we
//             want to override.
